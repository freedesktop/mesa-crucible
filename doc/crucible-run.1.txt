NAME

crucible-run - run tests

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*crucible run* [--fork|--no-fork] [--no-cleanup] [--dump|--no-dump]
               [--[no-]separate-cleanup-threads] [<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run tests in the order given on the command line. If no tests are given, then
run all tests (except example tests). The list of <pattern>s may consist of
a mixture of literal test names and glob patterns.

You can list all non-example tests with *crucible-ls-tests(1)*, and list
examples tests with *crucible-ls-example-tests(1)*.  (Example tests are those
whose names match "example.*").

OPTIONS
-------
--fork, --no-fork [default: enabled]::
    Run tests outside or inside the test runner's master process. With forking
    enabled, the test runner's master process is protected from test crashes.
    However, forking also makes debugging tests more difficult.

--no-cleanup::
    Disable each test's cleanup phase. This is useful because a test may crash
    during cleanup but otherwise pass.

--dump, --no-dump [default: disabled]::
    Dump (or disable dumping) test images into Crucible's data directory.

--use-spir-v::
    Use SPIR-V shaders when available.

--[no-]separate-cleanup-threads [default: enabled]::
    If enabled, then the test's "result" thread [1] will create a new thread
    in which to run the test's cleanup handlers. If disabled, then the cleanup
    handlers will run directly in the "result" thread.
    +
    This option is useful for detecting and investigating driver bugs that
    occur when objects are created in one thread and destroyed in another.
    +
    [fn1] The test's "result" thread is the one that chooses the test result,
    thus ending the test, usually by calling functions t_pass(), t_fail(), or
    t_assert().
